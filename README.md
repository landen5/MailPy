# MailPy
Simple Gmail automation python script. The features I have so far is the ability to login to your gmail acount. 


## Basic Setup
Make sure you have python installed on your system. 
1. Open cmd or terminal and type: pip install selenium
2. Download chromedriver from https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.42/ and select the appropriate version for your system. Once its done downloading, extract it to a place where you can quickly acess it in the future. 
3. Open up MailPy and edit "startbot.py" file with your desired text editor. 
4. Copy the location of chrome driver into the script. 
5. Enter in the email and password of the gmail account you want to use. 
6. Run the script!
